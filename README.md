## 🔐 API Key Setup

To use AuraWeather, you need to add your own weather API key:

1. Open `gradle.properties` (create it if it doesn't exist).
2. Add your API key:

    ```
    WEATHER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```

3. Ensure `gradle.properties` is listed in your `.gitignore` to avoid leaking sensitive data.
